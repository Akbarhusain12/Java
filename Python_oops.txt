Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods to manipulate that data. It promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
